Hello this is a todo list in the project.

1. Make it so when edges are added we ignore duplicate edges - this can be done
by changing the vector that holds edges to an unordered_set or simply checking
before adding. The unordered_set is prefered.

2. Write something that creates a graph object from a text file. To make testing
easier.

3. Write unit tests for the graph class
